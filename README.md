# LaTeX-rs

An ergonomic library for programatically generating LaTeX documents and reports.

This originally came from a desire to create an alternate renderer for [mdbook]
which saves to PDF. I quickly found that I needed a library for programatically
generating LaTeX documents from an AST and because there wasn't anything out
there which suited my use case, I made my own.
